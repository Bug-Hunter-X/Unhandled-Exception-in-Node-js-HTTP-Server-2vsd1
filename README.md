This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js: unhandled exceptions. The `bug.js` file contains a simple HTTP server that throws an error without proper handling.  The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to correctly handle this exception using the `server.on('error', ...)` event listener, ensuring the server remains operational even in the face of unexpected issues. This improved error handling is crucial for building robust and reliable Node.js applications.
